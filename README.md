## Overview
Nowcher is Web application providing online discount food vouchers instead of distributing paper one on the street. Restaurant owners can upload vouchers can be used in their shop on the app and general users (potential customers) can get it. General user bring it with mobile phone and use it over the counter. 

### Problem
One of the most common difficulty for restaurants is to obtain stable number of customers constantly. Although the restaurant that is very busy on every weekends, it sometimes happens that any customers show up (I actually experienced when I worked for a restaurant). Inventory management is also important duty since it could directory influence the cost. However, it always bother restaurant owners because their stuff (or theirselves) sometimes order ingredients exceedingly by mistake, or food was not ordered as much as expected. They want to sell them as soon as possible even though their price is lower than usual. -The life of food is short.

### Solution
Discount voucher is a good tool to stimulate customers to visit the restaurant. Furthermore, if restaurant owners can provide it to customers anytime they want by  online, this enable them to attract customers urgently in above situation.
